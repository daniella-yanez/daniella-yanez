***Olympic Medalists Data Analysis***

**TLDR**:  This project cleans and analyzes Olympic medalist data using Python. It reshapes the dataset into a tidy format, applies aggregation functions, and visualizes insights with Seaborn and Matplotlib.

**Description**: This project focuses on cleaning, organizing, and analyzing Olympic medalist data using Python. The dataset is reshaped into a tidy format, ensuring that each observational unit has its own table. Data wrangling techniques such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and extracting relevant features (e.g., gender and sport) are applied.

To explore insights, pivot tables and aggregation functions are used to summarize key trends, such as medal distribution by different attributes. Additionally, a heatmap visualization is created using Seaborn to highlight patterns in the data, such as medal distribution across different categories. This project demonstrates data cleaning, transformation, and visualization techniques, making it a valuable exercise in working with real-world sports data.
