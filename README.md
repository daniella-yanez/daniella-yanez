### **Strategic Projects**

These are some of my key projects showcasing my skills and expertise. Each project is designed to push the boundaries of my knowledge while contributing to real-world applications.

1. **[Tidy Data Project: Data Cleaning & Visualization using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib](https://github.com/daniella-yanez/Yanez-Data_Science-Portfolio/tree/7a3ab095e865df407cda39b79a3d1b92b8b242d7/TidyData-Project)**  
   Cleaned and reshaped Olympic medalist data from the 2008 Olympics, demonstrating my ability to turn raw, unstructured data into a tidy format suitable for further analysis and visualization.

2. **[Machine Learning App ‚Äì Streamlit Deployment: Interactive ML Models with Performance Metrics](https://github.com/daniella-yanez/Yanez-Data_Science-Portfolio/tree/53a4b48a459b8be10ed9a885d07a14c0d7084c89/MLStreamlitApp)**  
   Built a web application where users can upload datasets, train classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN), and evaluate performance metrics (accuracy, classification reports, confusion matrices). The app also allows users to adjust model hyperparameters and visualize real-time results.

3. **[Unsupervised Learning Explorer: Clustering & Dimensionality Reduction Web App](https://github.com/daniella-yanez/Yanez-Data_Science-Portfolio/tree/53a4b48a459b8be10ed9a885d07a14c0d7084c89/MLUnsupervisedApp)**  
   Created an interactive app for exploring unsupervised learning techniques such as **K-Means Clustering**, **Hierarchical Clustering**, and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**. The app allows users to upload datasets and interactively explore clustering methods and dimensionality reduction.
